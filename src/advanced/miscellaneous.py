"""
10 Essential Python Tips And Tricks For Programmers Python is one of the most preferred languages out there.
Its brevity and high readability makes it so popular among all programmers.
So here are few of the tips and tricks you can use to bring up your Python programming game.
"""

# 1. In - Place Swapping Of Two Numbers.
x, y = 10, 20
print(x, y)
x, y = y, x
print(x, y)
# Output:
#
# 10
# 20
# 20
# 10

# 2. Reversing a string in Python

a = "GeeksForGeeks"
print("Reverse is", a[::-1])
# Output:
#
# Reverse is skeeGroFskeeG

# 3. Create a single string elements in list

a = ["Geeks", "For", "Geeks"]
print(" ".join(a))
# Output:
#
# Geeks
# For
# Geeks

# 4. Chaining Of Comparison Operators.
n = 10
result = 1 < n < 20
print(result)
result = 1 > n <= 9
print(result)
# Output:
#
# True
# False

# 4. Print The File Path Of Imported Modules.

import os
import socket

print(os)
print(socket)


# Output:
# < module 'os' from '/usr/lib/python3.5/os.py' >
# < module 'socket' from '/usr/lib/python3.5/socket.py' >

# 5. Use Of Enums In Python.

class MyName:
    Geeks, For, Geeks = range(3)


print(MyName.Geeks)
print(MyName.For)
print(MyName.Geeks)


# Output:
#
# 2
# 1
# 2

# 6. Return Multiple Values From Functions.


def x():
    return 1, 2, 3, 4


a, b, c, d = x()

print(a, b, c, d)
# Output:
#
# 1
# 2
# 3
# 4

# 7. Find The Most Frequent Value In A List.


test = [1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 2, 3, 1, 4, 4, 4]
print(max(set(test), key=test.count))
# Output:
#
# 4

# 8. Check The Memory Usage Of An Object.    
import sys

x = 1
print(sys.getsizeof(x))
# Output:
# 
# 28

# 9. Print string N times.    
n = 2
a = "GeeksforGeeks"
print(a * n)
# Output:
# GeeksforGeeksGeeksforGeeks

# 10.Checking if two words are anagrams    
from collections import Counter


def is_anagram(str1, str2):
    return Counter(str1) == Counter(str2)


print(is_anagram('geek', 'eegk'))

print(is_anagram('geek', 'peek'))
# Output:
# 
# True
# False
